#hw2_lists.cpp

Takes two lines of numbers, creates two 
linked lists and will concatenate them,
removes even numbers from the resulting
list, and then calculates the decimal 
average for the remaining numbers.

To run file, you will need:

1. input file (.txt), with two lines of 
int numbers
2. output file (.txt) to print the
concatenated list, list w/o evens, 
and average.
